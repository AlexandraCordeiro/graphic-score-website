# personal_website
Project carried out as part of the Web Development course.
The goal is to create a personal website with a strong emphasis on programming, creativity, and experimentation.

# Concept
The premise for this website is the creation of a graphic score.
Against the backdrop of the classic structure of a score, various minimalist elements are laid out on the website, such as circles, squares, and rectangles.
These elements can be dragged around as the page visitor wishes, in order to create their graphic composition.
Personal information is arranged between the music staves, encouraging scrolling to the bottom of the page, where there are icons with auxiliary links, such as:
- Spotify: directs to a curated list of Jazz, Classical, and Bossa Nova playlists.
- LinkedIn
- Email
  
Finally, visitors can download their graphic score.
