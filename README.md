# Concept
The premise for this website is the creation of a graphic score.
Against the backdrop of the classic structure of a score, various minimalist elements are laid out on the website, such as circles, squares, and rectangles.
These elements can be dragged around as the page visitor wishes, in order to create their graphic composition.  
Finally, visitors can download their graphic score.
